Following are several compelling reasons you should not, under any circumstance, be my boss.
In all sincerity, and with kindness and compassion, please don&amp;rsquo;t be my boss if&amp;hellip;

      <description>Are you on the fence? Have I piqued your curiosity? Are you just scrolling because the colors are pretty? In all three cases, there&amp;rsquo;s likely a question below, and an answer below it, that will spark your fancy.
