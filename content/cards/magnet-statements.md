explanation: "Set up the space for easy movement. Prime the group with a topic or concept, and ask for one participant to make a related statement they believe. Other participants respond by moving closer or farther based on their agreement or disagreement. Ask for another statement, then repeat."
longer_context: "The ideal space is a wide-open area where participants can easily move past one another, be at varying distances, and reposition themselves without navigating around obstacles. If you need to move chairs, tables, or other furniture in the room, be sure to do this before giving instructions or you will likely have to repeat yourself.
Set up by introducing the topic.  You want a topic that is broad enough to allow for a lot of differences of interpretation and opinion, but narrow enough that it will spark strong reactions in your participants. 
After you’ve introduced the topic, give the instructions for the process: “We are going to be inviting you to make ‘magnet’ statements, one at a time, in response to this topic. After someone makes a statement that is true for them, we ask that you position yourself within the space as a response to how much you find yourself aligning with the statement. If you absolutely agree, move right next to them. The more you disagree, the further you should move away. We’ll then ask someone who isn’t in agreement to revise the statement such that it’s true for them. We’ll repeat this process several times, responding with our movement to different statements from new voices.” 
Be sure to specify the ways you’ll be inviting people to make statements (e.g., “I’ll pick people to respond,” “Raise your hand if you want to make a statement”), and know that you can change up how you allow participants to respond throughout the process. In general, it’s good to hear from people who are on their own in the room, because their response will often shake up the arrangement of the room.
Between each magnet statement, invite the participants to observe where they are and where the group is as a whole before the next person makes a statement.
Let the *Magnet Statements* run for as long as you like, until the group runs out of statements to make, or until you feel the energy waning. "

why_these_categories: "This tool provides a means for everyone in the group to participate and express their thoughts and opinions without actually needing to verbally respond. The bigger the group the better, because you’ll have a wider range of statements shared, showcasing the variety of perspectives in the group through movement. At times, there will be several islands of belief, which can suddenly transform into one unified continent. This allows the entire group to get a sense of where the rest of the group is quickly on a wide range of ideas. "
modifying_group: "For small groups, designate an area within your larger space for each group (e.g., divide the room into quadrants for four groups). Change the goals slightly: challenge participants within each small group to make statements in response to the prompt that results in everyone in their group standing near them. As long as there’s disagreement (distance between participants), they need to keep revising the statement until everyone can agree (or they give up, or run out of time). Once every small group is in agreement (or they run out of time), have them share the statement with the full group, and invite the other groups’ participants to respond with movement. Did you find a statement everyone in the room agrees with? You can repeat this several times, giving the groups short time limits (e.g., 3 minutes) for each prompt."
modifying_for: "To use *Magnet Statements* as an ideation tool, identify a topic for the group to start to make suggestions about. The first person starts by making a suggestion. Participants then spread out according to how far away their idea was from that first suggestion. If they had the exact same idea they should stand right next to the person, a slightly different idea they’d move a small distance away, and a completely different or opposing idea a large distance away. Have participants of varying distances share their ideas. 
For clarification, instead of having participants make one statement after another provide time for participants to share their reasoning. Once participants move after a statement is made, provide an opportunity for a few participants to share why they moved where they did. After a few shares have been made. Invite another statement and repeat the process. 
For execution, have participants make statements about what they want moving forward. Having participants respond to these statements by moving closer or further can operate as a barometer to get a sense of how much support a particular future step might receive."
excels_at: "**Quickly surfacing where the entire group stands in relation to a particular opinion (literally and metaphorically!).** Conversations can quickly introduce dozens of different opinions, and it’s difficult to know how much everyone agrees or disagrees with anything being said. But *Magnet Statements* force the group to weigh in on everything being said, giving you a good snapshot of everyone’s opinions. 
**Getting to know a group and having the group get to know each other.** Additionally, because the participants are the ones making the statements, you can gain insight into the group both from the statements they make and their responses.
**Non-verbal communication and mixing up the energy of the space.** If you’ve been talking a lot, or sitting still, *Magnet Statements* is a great way to change the pace of your facilitation. Non-verbal communication is a fun break from talking, and physically moving around can awaken a dormant participant.
**Challenging participants to make declarative statements.** Often conversations stall out because people won’t state what they think or believe. This set up helps overcome that inertia by making bold declarations the only option for verbal participation. "
use_when: "**Use Magnet Statements, not “Go Around” or Popcorn Share, when…** it’s more important for you to know where the entire group stands in relation to a few opinions than it is to hear individual opinions from everyone in the group.
**Use Magnet Statements, not Airport Sign, when…** you want to create an opportunity for movement and it’s helpful for your participants to respond to one another’s opinions. 
**Use Magnet Statements, not Concentric Circles, when…** you want to make sure everyone is involved in one universal conversation, having the opportunity to react differently to the same opinions being shared."
not_when: "**If you want to have control over what the group is responding to.** This tool works best when you give control of the statements made over to the group. If there are particular statements you want them to respond to, or you need to control the content in general, *Spectrum Statements* or *Fill in the Gap* are better fits. 
**The space doesn’t work.** If there simply isn’t space to move, don’t try to force it. Participants will not only be irritated by having to navigate furniture, but this annoyance can lead them to move less which will diminish the usefulness of the tool. Use *Finger Voting* (1 = completely disagree, 5 = completely agree) in response to participant-generated statements instead."
stacks: "**Magnet Statements + 5 Why’s =** While the group is moving through *Magnet Statements*, be on the lookout for a statement that seems to really activate the group. Perhaps people think longer about it, the group is more spread out, or people are more surprised to see other people’s reactions than with other statements. Use that statement to formulate an initial question for *5 Why’s*. 
**Magnet Statements + Poster Presentations =** While the group is making statements, consider which statements could be expanded upon for further clarity and understanding. After *Magnet Statements* break the group into small groups based on their opinions about particular statements. Have each group create a poster to present to the full group that explains their position. 
**Magnet Statements + Matchstick Convos =** Take note during *Magnet Statements* of contentious statements and statements that people have strong emotional reactions to. After *Magnet Statements* comes to a close, transition the group into *Matchstick Convos* to further discuss these particular statements to gain further insight and understanding.
**Magnet Statements + What’s the MVP =** Prompt the group to make statements that they believe should be included in the initial MVP. Anytime someone makes a statement where all participants agree (i.e., there is only one big glob of people), capture it on a sticky note and post it in on a surface designated for “MVP.” Statements with close to the entire group can also be captured on stickies as MVP candidates for further investigation."
