Choose a few talkers, and ask the rest of the group to mute their mics and turn off their cameras. Provide the group with a theme or prompt, and let the small group converse for an allotted amount of time. Swap in different talkers, repeat.
### Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Decide who will start “in the fishbowl,” being observed by everyone else. Name a few people randomly, or select a subgroup based on a common identifier (e.g., roles, titles, traits), to be the talkers.
2. Instruct everyone who isn’t chosen to talk to mute their mics and hide their cameras. Ask them to observe the talkers, listening closely, and giving them 100% focus.
3. Provide the group with a central question, prompt, or theme for their discussion. And tell them how much time you’re allotting (e.g., “You’ll have 7 minutes.”).
4. When the time is up, assign new people to be talkers, unmuting their mics and enabling their cameras, while the previous talkers go dark and transition into listening.
5. You can provide the new group in the fishbowl with a related central question or topic, or allow them to continue the conversation about the same one. Tell them how much time they have, instruct everyone else to listen.
6. Repeat as many times as you’d like, or for as long as new dimensions of the topic are being explored."
