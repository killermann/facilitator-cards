Place a central concept that you want to explore at the center of your Mural board. Have participants use stickies to generate all the ideas, themes, and sub-categories that branch from it. Encourage them to continue to explore those sub-themes, creating more branches extending out to the edges of the board.
### Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Introduce the activity by describing what a mindmap is, a model for visualizing a information by having a central theme and creating branches of all the related ideas.
2. Optional: show an example of an already completed mindmap that starts with a very different central theme from what you’ll be focusing on (e.g., “Breakfast Foods” is a great example mindmap, unless you’re facilitating a breakfast food workshop, in which case where do we sign up?).
3. Share the central theme with the group, and give them a moment to consider it, and ask any clarifying questions they have about it.
4. Provide the instructions and rules for how you’re going to be using Mural. (e.g., if you’re limiting participation, using certain sticky types, colors to denote the levels of hierarchy)
5. Check in for questions or clarifications on the instructions. Make sure people understand the central theme you’re going to be mapping (especially if it’s jargon), the tools you’ll be using in Mural (or not using), and their individual roles.
6. Invite everyone into the Mural by sharing the link in the Zoom chat. Optional: mute all if you want this to be a silent activity.
7. Map from your central concept, using stickies for nodes and drawing lines for connections. Keep going until you feel you’ve fully fleshed out the idea, run out of space in your Mural, or run out of time. "
