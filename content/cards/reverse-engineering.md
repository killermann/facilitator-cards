explanation: "Ask participants to imagine that they\'re in a future where you\'ve accomplished your goals or achieved perfection in regards to a particular concept. Viewing that finished product, what steps were taken to accomplish it? What pitfalls were avoided? Have them record their reflections on paper. State your intentions for sharing before they start writing."
longer_context: "Pass out paper and writing utensils to participants. After everyone has supplies, provide initial context for the activity. Give the instructions, asking participants to imagine they’re in a future where whatever you’re currently concerned with (i.e., the project, goal, concept, idea) is perfect. A utopian version of whatever you’re focusing on. Pause for a moment so they can reflect on that idea.

This is one of those situations where the old adage “there is no ‘correct’ answer” answer applies. You want to encourage them to come up with as bold, creative, or unique of an idea for their future as they feel compelled to imagine. No limitations and this won’t be graded. It’s okay if everyone’s answers are different. If you’re going to be having them share their reflections, tell them that up front.

After they’ve had a moment to reflect, ask them to write down any thoughts they have on how that future was accomplished. For example, “What needed to happen in order to get to that perfect future? What were the steps taken to succeed? How were pitfalls avoided along the way? What were the big milestones? Forks in the road? Decisions?”"

why_these_categories: "Having participants work as individuals on this activity allows participants to generate different ideas for what the perfect future would look like and the steps to get there. This enables the group to get a sense of what everyone is currently viewing as the ideal outcome, with all the different outcomes and steps along the way.

You’ll often find that many of the ideas people come up with are universally helpful, even when their ideal futures vary."
modifying_group: "For pairs or small groups, the tricky part is going to be ensuring everyone agrees on what their utopian future is. You can do this in one of two ways: establish a consensus on what that is beforehand (then have pairs or small groups split up to ideate on the steps), or build consensus-making into the process. After your groups have consensus, you can follow through on the process exactly as you do individually, having everyone contribute ideas and recording them."
modifying_for: "For emotion, ask participants how they feel right now regarding the project or the topic at hand. Then ask them to write down what are all the things that are going on that contributed to their current state. “What needed to happen in order for you to feel the way you do right now?” Alternatively, if you want to have them envision a future emotional state, ask them how they would like to feel about the topic at hand, “What would an ideal future emotional state be?” Have them brainstorm about that future emotional state, determining what would have needed to happen in order for them to feel that way.

For clarification, have participants reverse engineer what it took to accomplish something that’s already happened (i.e., a project, creation, organization, or current status quo). “What led to the thing that currently exists existing?” You can do this individually, in small groups, or as a full group.

excels_at: "**When open-ended brainstorming feels overwhelming.** There is a philosophy when teaching chess that has the learner start with just the final pieces left on the board (the “end game”), instead of learning from the starting position with all pieces in play (the “opening”). *Reverse Engineering* works similarly, removing all the pieces you don’t need, and working your way backward from a successful endgame.

**Quality over quantity.** The ideas generated by *Reverse Engineering* will tend to be fewer in numbers than other ideation processes, but more likely to be useful. Because you’re asking for people to consider their impact, and alignment within an overall process, the ideas that surface are more likely to be strong contenders.

**Getting clear on the destination.** Sometimes conversation gets stuck in the, “How are we going to do this?” and never gets to the, “What are we working towards?” and “Are we united in the vision?” This tool requires people to get clear about what outcomes would manifest in their perfect world, and what would need to happen to get there.

**Starting fresh.** Sometimes we get stuck in trying to solve problems because our thinking is too focused on what is already happening, or has happened. This can limit us to incremental thinking, or bind our options. *Reverse Engineering* is great because it allows our thinking to be shaped by what we want to be true rather than by what has happened in the past, or is currently true."
use_when: "**Use Reverse Engineering, not Generate a List when...** you want to provide space for people to ideate on their own. When members of the group are dominating the conversation it’s hard for the quieter or more reflective participants to get their ideas out, or to have a chance to sit with their ideas, *Reverse Engineering* creates an opportunity for everyone to do deep thinking before discussing their ideas with the group.

**Use Reverse Engineering, not Drawing a Caricature when…** you want the ideas generated to be related as part of a process, not merely thematically related to your central concept."
not_when: "**You want to focus on the low hanging fruit.** The ideas that are surfaced in this process are thoughtful, and tend to require a lot of mental work. If you just want the first things that come to people’s minds, we recommend *Make a List* instead.

**Individuals aren’t likely to be able to imagine a clear future regarding your concept.** If they don’t have the agency to effect change, or necessary information to imagine the steps, creating a mental utopia will likely be frustrating, impossible, or unhelpful. Use *I Know vs. I Wonder* instead.

**You need everyone to be on the same page.** There are likely going to be many divergent paths that result from individualized *Reverse Engineering*. If you need full group consensus, or for everyone to be working from a shared understanding, use *Opposite Thinking* instead."
stacks: "**Reverse Engineering + Subcommittees =** After participants have their lists for *Reverse Engineering*, have them share their favorite ideas with the full group. Listen for shares that could be rolled into themes within the overall process (e.g., people involved, stages, content). Note these themes as you go. Then break the group into *Subcommittees* based on each theme, to expand on or clarify the ideas shared.

**Reverse Engineering + Sticky Note Generator + Urgent vs. Important Grid =** Instead of capturing their reverse engineering ideas in a list, have them generate stickies. After they’re done, create a giant *Urgent vs. Important Grid* and have participants add their stickies to the grid.

**Reverse Engineering + Mindmapping =** After participants have all generated their own list, have them share ideas with the full group. Capture unique ideas on sticky notes. After everyone has shared, create a mindmap with the stickies, adding nodes for the themes that you see in their ideas. Alternatively, you could make a mindmap as people share, but the sticky notes make it simpler to move ideas around as themes emerge."

Ask participants to imagine that they're in a future where you've accomplished your goals or achieved perfection in regards to a particular concept. Viewing that finished product, what steps were taken to accomplish it? What pitfalls were avoided? Have them record their reflections on paper. State your intentions for sharing before they start writing.
