for: "Execution"
prop_1: "Sticky Notes"

prop_3: ""
explanation: "After generating ideas and wanting to narrow down your focus, write the possible plans down on individual stickies and put them on surface. Have the group “dot vote” by placing their dots (circle stickers, with markers, etc.) on the idea they support. You can vary the number of votes, how people can allocate their votes, and more based on your goals."
longer_context: "To prep for *Dot Voting* take ideas and plans the group has identified they want to vote on and write them up on sticky notes, one idea per sticky note. Place these sticky notes in a place that is easily accessible for the group. Everyone will need to be able to see and to interact with the sticky notes. Writing with markers can help make the writing more bold and legible from a distance.
Before inviting participants to vote, read out the sticky notes out loud for everyone to hear (or ask a participant to volunteer to do this). You can do this in addition to having all the participants read the sticky notes before voting. Regardless of your method of review, do not have people begin voting until everyone has had a chance to review the sticky notes they’ll be voting on.
Once everyone in the group knows what is on sticky notes, provide instructions and rules for voting. The instructions and rules should include; (1) where people should place their dots (2) how many votes each person gets (3) how they can allocate their votes. For example, “Everyone is going to have the next few minutes to cast their votes, everyone has five votes. You can split these votes up between whatever number of sticky notes you would like or cast all of your votes for one sticky note. You’ll vote by placing your dot on the sticky note that you’re voting for.” 
The dots can be made by giving people small dot stickers (easy to find at office supply stores) or by giving everyone a marker they can use to create a dot to cast their votes. "

general_notes: "Custom = small colored dots, easily found at office supply stores, could use markers (and just color the dots) in a pinch"

attribution_notes: "No copyright stuff."
why_these_categories: "This tool is full group because the focus is for all group members to decide what ideas or plans to focus on, providing a structured and relatively quick way to hear everyone’s priorities among a large set of options. Dot Voting enables simple decision-making and a clear way for the group to direct future plans."
modifying_group: "Pair people up with a partner. Let them know as a ‘partner pair’ they have a certain number of votes to cast and that they need to decide together how to cast their votes. Give them 2-3 minutes to discuss how they want to allocate their votes, then ask for one member of each pair to go up and cast their votes."
modifying_for: "For emotion, give your participants dots or markers of several different colors, and create a bunch of emotion stickies (e.g., \"excited,\" \"nervous,\" \"angry,\" \"anxious,\" \"happy,\" \"content,\" \"regretful\"). Give the group a prompt, and ask them to put their (specified) color dot on the emotion that best describes how that prompt makes them feel. For example, \"Using your green dot, tell me how you feel about...\" Change the color and give another prompt. Repeat. After all the votes, note the different reactions to the different statements.
For ideation, you can reward participants with one dot per sticky note idea they generate for voting. If someone comes up with five ideas and gives you five stickies, they get five dots. Consider amending the rules to allow participants to put multiple dots on the ideas they love (to add more value to their extra dots). And be sure to decide beforehand whether or not you’ll let people vote on their own ideas (in general, we suggest you forbid this).
For clarification, let people know that they aren’t voting for the ideas that they want to advance, but for the ideas that they feel confused about or want more information about. So, in the end, the most voted idea shouldn’t be “the best one,” but the most ambiguous, unclear, or in need of explaining. "
excels_at: "**No-debate decision making.** This tool allows people to simply vote without explanation. There is no talking (other than to read out the sticky notes) between participants which can be a relief when a lot of decision-making processes are conversation-heavy.
**Reducing a lot of options down to a few.** You’ve done the hard work of generating all the ideas, this card allows you to reduce those ideas down to just the ones that are worth keeping around. 
**Seeing the outliers.** In execution processes, it is easy to be focused on what most of the group wants, but there are times when it’s important to know where are they outliers? What are things that only one person is thinking about or wanting? This tool allows you to assess the majority while also making it clear what is important to even just one participant in the room."
use_when: "**Use Dot Voting, not Vanishing Options when…** you want to be able to see the full spread of votes. Dot Voting allows you to see where the majority is, but also which items only had one or two votes. 
**Use Dot Voting, not Finger Voting when…** you want votes to be anonymous. Dot Voting allows you to see everyone’s votes without seeing what each person is voting for.
**Use Dot Voting, not Inside vs. Outside Thinking when…** you only want to focus on the opinions of the people in the room speaking for themselves."
not_when: "**It’s important for participants to examine their own motivations.** In *Dot Voting* participants don’t have to share or even understand the motivations for their decisions. When it’s important for participants to have a clear understanding of their motivations and be able to share that thought process with others, we’d recommend *5 Why’s* instead.
**You want to know if people are yay or nay on every item.** If you simply need a “yes” or “no” on each idea from the group consider *Heads Down, Hands Up* instead. 
**You want or need voting to be done individually.** If you think your group may be swayed by each other’s opinions or reluctant to vote for what they truly want in front of each other consider *Rank Order Voting* instead. 
**You want to make a final decision.** While this tool is great for narrowing the options down, the amount of options on the table and the lack of conversation within the group about their votes makes it an unhelpful last step. Consider *Vanishing Options* or *What’s the MVP?* Instead."
stacks: "**FAQ + Dot Voting + Subcommittees =** Put your list of FAQs up on a surface that is dot-vote-friendly. Allow all of your participants to cast their votes for questions that they want answers to (limit the votes to one or two per person), then break them into subcommittees to answer the questions that get the most votes.
**SWOT + Dot Voting =** Have the group do a SWOT analysis, capturing the different sections on individual sticky notes. After participants to vote on what strengths and opportunities they have identified are most important to them for the final project to incorporate. 
**Dot Voting + Vanishing Options =** Use *Dot Voting* to narrow the number of ideas or plans on the table. Then with those few final options, use *Vanishing Options* to narrow the final ideas down to one. 
**Dot Voting + Inside vs. Outside Thinking =** Provide framing as you would for *Inside vs. Outside Thinking* prompting the group to consider the options on the sticky notes from an “insider” and “outsider” viewpoints. Have participants vote using one color dots to vote from an “insider” perspective and use different color dots to cast votes from their “outsider” perspective. "
