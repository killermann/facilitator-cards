Each person makes a Google Slide proclaiming a statement (should be short, with a large font, and easily readable). After everyone has made their sign, have them turn on screen sharing and display it, then ask the group to quietly click through everyone’s views, giving them enough time to read one another’s signs.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Introduce the activity by explaining you’re going to have everyone make an airport sign (i.e., a sign a driver holds to find their passenger disembarking an airplane, from back before ridesharing)

2. Tell them you’ll give them a prompt to respond to, then ask everyone to open up Google Slides and create a sign with a short message, in a large, easy-to-read font. And that once they’re done writing, they should switch from camera to screen share.

3. Check in for questions or clarifications on this instruction before giving the prompt (also giving the participants who weren’t logged into Google Slides a little panic time to get that ready)

4. Provide your prompt. (This can really be anything, from “How are you feeling?” to “What message do you need to hear right now?”) Mute all participants.

5. Switch your Zoom view to be tiles of all the participants, and either give people time updates (i.e., “You have 1 more minute”) or just watch for screens to transition from faces to slides.

6. When all the faces have become signs, invite your participants to start clicking through them, silently reflecting on what they’re reading.

7. If you have a large group, set a time limit and invite them to read however many they can. For smaller groups, ask them to read everyone’s sign (you can have them signal to you by “raising their hand” on Zoom when they’re done)."
