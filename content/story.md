One day, not so long ago, a pair of co-facilitators had gotten themselves into trouble. With a three-day training just one week away, they learned their plan wouldn’t work, and they didn’t have time to get the information they needed to make a new plan (oh no!). What were they going to do?‌

They would have to create the training as it happened, using each activity to plan the next. It was a big challenge.

To prepare, they thought hard about every activity and process they had ever facilitated or participated in. Then they wrote each one down on an index card. And they brought a whole stack with them to facilitate the training. It was a great success! (Hooray!)

For years, Meg & Sam kept remaking these index cards, even when they weren’t in trouble. The cards helped them be creative and made [planning](https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/adding-modularity-to-your-facilitation-planning/) new facilitations easy and fun.

Then Sam had an idea. What if these were [real cards](https://www.facilitator.cards/cards/)? What if we made them beautiful, indestructible, and reusable? Sam started [researching](https://www.facilitator.cards/blog/questions-we-asked-manufacturers/) what it would take, then got to designing the cards. Meg thought it was a great idea and was excited to help. 

Fast forward through two years of testing, tweaking, and feedback, Meg & Sam reached out to their facilitator communities to see if the excitement was mutual. [339 facilitators](https://www.facilitator.cards/about/bigger-us) said, “Yep!”, funding the manufacturing of the first deck on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/facilitatorcards/facilitator-cards). 

And Facilitator Cards were born!
